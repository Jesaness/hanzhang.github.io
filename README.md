This is my personal website! 

I have created a personal website using google sites:

This project aims to mimic the above website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and potentially add more features.

PLANNED:
- making the website responsive to different display sizes
- pages
    - about me
    - projects
    - contact
- adding projects to projects page.

IN PROGRESS:
- page
    - home page
- color design (?)

COMPLETED:
- navigation bar
- home page
    - profile picture, blurb, embedded youtube video
    - padding on sides.

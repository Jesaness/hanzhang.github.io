            <h2>Hi There, my name is Han!</h2>
            <p>I am Sophomore majoring in Computer Science at the University of Michigan. 
                My passion for technology and problem solving began at a young age when I learned the pattern of traffic light and directing my dad at an intersection near my childhood home. 
                Now, Iâ€™m excited to delve deeper into software development and data science to create innovative solution for frictions in our daily lives. 
                Through my coursework and projects, Iâ€™ve developed skills in programming languages such as C++, Python, Java, and Javascript+CSS+HTML. 
                I am eager to apply my knowledge in real-world settings and explore innovative solutions in the tech industry and beyond!</p>

            <p>I hope to use this space to document my exploration of the world and personal reflections.
